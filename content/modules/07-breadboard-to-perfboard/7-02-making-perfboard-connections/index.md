## Board Mount Connectors

Many connectors come in panel mount form, board mount form and cord form. When prototyping on a breadboard, inserting jumper pins into the breadboard or into the header pins of the Arduino are a type of panel mount connector. The cable or pin attaches to a point that is soldered to the board. Unfortunately, jumper wires and header pins are not the most durable, reliable, or permanent connection.

Each component and wire needs to be either soldered directly to the board or provided a way to connect to a board mount connector. If something needs to be removed to install the board, or if a component has different versions, then a board mount connecter can be a good option. Otherwise it is usually best to solder as much as possible directly to the board.
