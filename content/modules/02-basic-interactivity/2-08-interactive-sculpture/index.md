## Assignment Deliverables

Upload a 5 second to 30 second video of an interactive sculpture reacting to user input.

Label the file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Interactive Sculpture Video.mp4

## Overview

Now that we can capture basic user input with buttons and knobs we will use this input to create simple interactive sculpures or experiences. Turning the knob might decide when to move the motor or pressing the button might make a sound or blink a light.

You can use the example sketches with user input from this lesson. Below are some additional ideas and concepts to try out. Don't hesitate to ask questions about this or adding additional actions / inputs.

This can be an expansion and refinement of your original "Servo Shenanigans". It could add additional servos or LEDs.

## Things to Try

- Use random numbers to introduce "unpredictability" to make it seem more alive or real. When the knob turns it could turn the servo 2 degrees plus a random number that could even make it go backwards. `random()` + `randomSeed()` with `min() max()` can accomplish this. Example code will be added here.
