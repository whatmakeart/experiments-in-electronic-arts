Now that we have multiple different sensors lets look at how we can combine two Arduino Sketches.

## 1 Copy all of the variables from before `setup();`

1. Copy all of the variables
2. Rename any duplicates
3. Reasign pins that are the same to different pins
4. Make notes about variable renaming
5. Make notes about pin reassignment

## 2 Copy information from `setup();`

1. Copy the new information
2. Update any varaiable names from previous step
3. Update any reassigned pins

## 3 Copy information from `loop();`

1. Copy the new information
2. Update any varaiable names from previous step
3. Update any reassigned pins

## Test, Test, Test

Then we must test the code to fix unexpected errors and problems.
