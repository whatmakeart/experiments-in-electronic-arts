Now that we have multiple different sensors lets look at how we can combine two Arduino Sketches.

Pick two of the example sketches we worked with so far in the course. It is bet to use examples that don't use the delay function.

- Arduino Fade
- Arduino Blink Without Delay
- Arduino Button Debounce
- Servo Knob Without Delay
- Microphone control LED
- Ultrasonic Sensor NewPing Library

Follow the guide for combining Arduino Sketches

## 1 Copy all of the variables from before `setup();`

1. Copy all of the variables
2. Rename any duplicates
3. Reassign pins that are the same to different pins
4. Make notes about variable renaming
5. Make notes about pin reassignment

## 2 Copy information from `setup();`

1. Copy the new information
2. Update any variable names from previous step
3. Update any reassigned pins

## 3 Copy information from `loop();`

1. Copy the new information
2. Update any variable names from previous step
3. Update any reassigned pins

## Test, Test, Test

Then we must test the code to fix unexpected errors and problems.
