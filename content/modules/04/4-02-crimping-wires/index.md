### Common JST Connectors for Electronics Projects

- PH Connector is used for connecting wires to boards such as PCB or component modules. These have a 2.0mm pitch and a current rating of 2 amps with 24 AWG wire.[^1]
- SH Connector is a wire to board connector that is detachable. It has a protruded edge that can be grasped to pull it out. [^5] Sparkfun's QUIIC system uses this type of JST connector. [^4]
- SM Connectors aer used to connect wires to wires. These are found in Adafruit's NewPixel LED strips. [^2]
- RCY connectors are used to connect wires to wires and have a locking device. They have a 2.5mm pitch. [^3]
