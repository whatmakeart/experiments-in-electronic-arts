Wires come in different sizes. They can be thick or thin, stranded or solid, copper or aluminum, the insulation can be PVC or silicone or other material. Depending on application. It is important to to choose the proper wire for your application. As a general rule of thumb, thicker wire will have a lower resistance and be able to carry more current or longer distance without voltage drop, while a thinner wire will have more resistance, heat up faster, and have more voltage drop when it is used over distances.

## Home Wiring

In the United States, household wiring is typically 14 AWG or 12 AWG. This is commonly denoted by the outside installation color of yellow for 12 AWG and white for 14 AWG but that has not always been the case. Always check the writing on the insulation of a particular wire or measure it with calipers to determine it's size.

## Electronics Wiring

Electronics projects use much thinner wire than household wiring for DC circuits. For transmitting power to LEDs or motors often. 16 or 18 gauge wire is more than sufficient. When hooking up small circuits to a breadboard, 22 gauge wire is often used. When using small wires over long distances. It's important to consider voltage drop, especially in DC circuits. Using a larger gauge wire can help with voltage drop over long distances by reducing resistance in the wire.

## Solid vs Stranded / Multi-core Wiring

A solid wire will have less resistance then stranded wire and has more structural integrity, but does not do well with vibration or movement. Solid wire is made up of a single copper or aluminum conductor inside the insulation, while stranded wire is made up of multiple strands of copper or aluminum inside the wiring insulation. Solid core wire can be attached to screw terminals directly with a secure connection, but stranded wire needs to be crimped into into a connector to have structural support and strain relief. If stranded wire is inserted into a screw terminal it will compress and become flat and not have a good connection. Stranded wire can also be soldered, but this often will wick solder up the strands, converting it to a solid core wire and negating the effects of the flexibility of the stranded wire. Wire. In any project that will have vibration or motion. It is generally better to use crimped connections rather than soldered connections unless the wire will not be moving.

## Stripping Wire

Stripping wire removes the insulation from the conductors at the end of the wire. So the metal conductors can be inserted into a device or a crimp connector. It is important to use proper tools to strip wire so the conductors are not damaged. This is especially true with stranded wire because slight damage can completely sever one of the strands and therefore change the size of the wire and increase its resistance.

Utility knives, or razor blades or pliers or any other non-dedicated wire stripping tools should never be used to strip wire. Wire. Always use a proper wire stripper so the chances of damaging the conductors is minimized as much as possible. The amount of insulation that needs to be stripped varies based on the intended purpose. If using crimp terminals, then there needs to be enough insulation to provide strain relief yet enough of the conductor exposed to fit into the crimp terminal. When making soldered connections on a perfect board or PCB, enough insulation needs to be removed for the wire to go through the hole and connect to the proper location. When stripping wires for household electrical wiring, there needs to be enough of the conductor exposed to make a tight connection inside a wire nut, but not have any of the conductor exposed outside of the pig tailed connection.

### Wire Stripping tools

Never use a razor blade to strip wire, you will likely damage the conductors.

Unless it's an emergency, do not use cheap wire strippers like this, they are not precisely machined, make the work more difficult, and also increase the likelihood of damaging the conductors.

Meijer strippers come in different sizes for different ranges of wire. Make sure you use the specific stripper for the size wire that you have. This style. Stripper works quite well for stripping wire. This style stripper clamps the wire and can be used for repeatable actions of wire stripped at a particular depth.

It's generally easier to trim the wire to the proper length before stripping, especially with stranded wire. It can take some practice to make sure that you remove the proper amount of insulation.

## Strain Relief

Wires are flexible and will hang from the locations that they are secured. This is especially true where wires terminate with crimp terminals or soldered connections. Chords coming from devices also receive a lot of stress. It is important to add strain relief to these connection points to prevent the wire from prematurely becoming damaged. Sometimes it can be as simple as the wire insulation crimped in the crimped terminal. For power supply cords, there are specific rubber strain relief devices that can be put around the cord. For smaller size wires, heat shrink tubing can be used to add some strain relief to wire connections.
