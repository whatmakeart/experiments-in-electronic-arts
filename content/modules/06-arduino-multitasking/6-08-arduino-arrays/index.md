Arrays are a data structure that can store multiple values. Arrays can also be used to write less code for repeating actions such as `pinMode();`.

`#define` is a preprocessor macro that replaces all instances of what is defined in the code with that value. For example `#define PIN 3` would replace all instances of `PIN` in the code with 3. This is different than a variable since it is not stored in RAM. [^1]
